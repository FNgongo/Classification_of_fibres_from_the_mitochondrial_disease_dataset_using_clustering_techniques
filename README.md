# Introduction
Understanding the project
Machine Learning to understand markers for Leigh Syndrome

Set out how I may apply machine model to solve this problem0r what method will be useful.

Specify what the solution is

Analysing and Visualizing Mass Cytometry data.

## There are two methods to analyse IMAGING MASS CYTOMETRY (IMC)
* Boolean gating to identify anticipated cell populations, deep cellular phenotyping
* High-dimensional analysis algorithms to extract new layers of insights

Cythos data analysis is an interactive process

_The focus question is can _

## Spectrum of Mass cytometry analysis

There are programmes that intergrate multiple algorithms as well as authomated analysis services. 
These algorithms have higher barrier to entry but allow customizing your data analysis.   

* Individual algorithms 
 * e.g: SPEDA, tSNE, X-shift, Flow SOM, PhenoGraph, Citrus, HSNE, UMAP, diffcyt...
* Programs that intergrate multiple algorithms
 * Cytofkit, Cytobank, FlowJo, Cytosplore, Cell Engine ...
* Automated analysis services
 * Astrolabe, Maxpar Pathsetter TM ...

## Data pre-processing and quality control.

One data are collected on the mass cytometer, files need to be processed 

* Normalization to beads
* Debarcoding (if applicable)
* Correct for signal spillover (if applicable)
* Identifying nucleated events (191Iridium+) that are viable ( 195 Platinium-)
